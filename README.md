Welcome to the Alpha version of our application! This project is currently under development and is part of a government-funded initiative. As such, the functionalities are limited at this stage, and we appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to develop and enhance the application.

Current Functionality
Given that this is an Alpha release, please note that not all planned features are available. The primary objective of this version is to gather initial user feedback and ensure the core functionalities are operating as intended.
